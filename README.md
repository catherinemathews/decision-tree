# decision-tree

In this project, I implemented a binary decision-tree classifier entirely from scratch. The mutual information criterion was used to determine which attribute to split on at each level of the tree. 
The classifier was used to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease and also to predict the final grades of high school students. 

Files:
- inspection.py: calculates the entropy at the root of the tree and the error rate of classifying using a majority vote
- decision_tree.py: learns a decision tree with a specified maximum depth, prints the tree's structure, predicts the labels of the training and test data, and calculates errors
